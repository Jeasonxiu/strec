STREC
=====

 STREC stands for SeismoTectonic Regime Earthquake Calculator. Itâ€™s purpose is to determine automatically the earthquake type (subduction zone interface, active crustal shallow, stable continental region, etc.) and the earthquake focal mechanism.

TOOLS
=====

There are three tools that come with STREC:

- strec.py - Determine the best seismo-tectonic regime and focal mechanism for an input earthquake.
- strec_convert.py - Convert data from CSV, NDK, or QuakeML XML into internal database format (SQLite).
- strec_init.py - Initialize STREC data directory with USGS NEIC Slab data and (optionally) GCMT data.
